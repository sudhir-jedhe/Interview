HTML Tip💡

If you're using target="_blank" to open any link in a new tab, then always add rel="noopener" or rel="noreferrer" or both like this:

// index.html
<a href="contact.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Us</a>

This solves a major security issue. When you don't have noopener or noreferrer added, the contact.html has full access to the previous page(index.html) through window.opener object.

This will allow the contact.html page to change the contents of index.html or redirect it to some malicious URL.

But when you add noopener or noreferrer, the opened page will not have access to window.opener object, so can't manipulate the original page.
